This project has been planned, implemented and executed as a part of my academic curriculumn at my Masters in Science in Applied Data Science and Analytics at SRH HOCHSCULE, HEIDELBERG.
A brief foreword:
Google recruits a lot of people worldwide for their tech related roles. One of their methods of recruitment is when they identify a qualified individual, and the individual open Google Chrome, they get a pop-up asking if they would be interested in working for Google.
If the individual is interested, they click on the 'yes' option and further instructions are received by the individual for the recruitment process.
The algorithm that has been designed for the identification of such talented individuals is unknown to people and nobody has still een able to understand how the algorithm identifies such individuals and reaches out to them.
My task was to implement this algorithm in a way that I deemed fit.
My way of implementing this algorithm started off by trying to identify data sources and finally collected Data from GitHub and StackOverflow using API's.
I then proceeded to clean the data (pre-processing). During this stage, I have removed null values, duplicates and more such data pre-processing steps.
Once the pre-processing was done, I have used unsupervsed Maachine learning algorithms such as K-Means in order to classify the candidate information into relevant groups.
I have then implemented a number of other ML algorithms to see which model was giving me more accurate results in terms of GitHub and StackOverflow users.
This in turn gave me a strong pool of candidates to choose from for recruitment.

I have also built a backend interface using Flask which in turn is the candidate information visible to the HR. She can further filter out the candidates using features such as 'programming languages' etc., The HR could then send out emails to the candidates that fit the requirement/profile.

This was my idea of implementing the project.
All ideas and suggestions or comments are welcome.
